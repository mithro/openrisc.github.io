### Mailing lists

There are three flavours of mailing list to support the OpenRISC
project.

1.  There is the web based [OpenRISC forum][] by OpenCores.org, which
    has been running since 2008.
2.  There are mailman mailing lists run by [openrisc.net][],
    particularly targeted at Linux for OpenRISC, which have been running
    since April/May 2011.
3.  There are mailman mailing lists run by [by OpenCores][], for
    OpenRISC and WishBone, which have been running since June 2011.

The mailing lists are relatively new (first half of 2011). However a
pattern of usage seems to be emerging, where general users ask their
questions on the OpenRISC forum, while developers discuss new design
ideas and post patches on the two OpenRISC mailing lists.

It is recognized that having two versions of the OpenRISC mailing list
(in addition to the Forum) is a problem. Efforts are under way to try to
merge into a single list (not just a technical problem). In the
meantime, contrary to normal advice, users are encouraged to cross-post
to ensure subjects are not missed.

#### OpenRISC forum

The [OpenRISC forum][] is maintained on the opencores.org website, and
is a web based discussion forum. Users can use full HTML to format their
messages, and all messages are help in a simple archive online. You can
ask to receive notifications of new messages, by going to “My Account”
(top left of this page, beneath the OpenCores logo) and selecting
“OpenRISC” under the **Subscriptions** section. Note. This will also add
you to the [opencores.org OpenRISC mailing list][].

A number of [other forums][] address other OpenCores projects (the
Ethernet MAC, PCI, USB etc).

#### Mailing lists on openrisc.net

Two are [mailing lists][openrisc.net] are provided by openrisc.net.
These tend to carry more technical discussion by developers and would-be
developers than the forum.

1.  The [Linux mailing list][] is for discussion of the port of Linux to
    OpenRISC. [Monthly archives][] are maintained, which can be browsed
    by name, subject, date or thread.

1.  The [OpenRISC mailing list][] is for general discussion of the
    OpenRISC architect
