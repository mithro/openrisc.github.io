For newcomers, but also for active members in the community, it was
quite hard lately to find information around the internet. The
[opencores website and wiki](http://opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page) look
less and less appealing and need some serious work to provide the
updated information. Other information, such as the Linux port or new
toolchains are either hard to find or split among several places.

Everybody knows about the situation and we have discussed to get a
least a simple landing page up and running again, so that both new
users but also active members of the community find there basic entry
point. It is of course not the full information and probably never
will be due to the vivid and wide-spread nature of the OpenRISC
community. But it should at least be a rewrite of the `0x100` vector
(the reset entry point the processor starts executing from).
