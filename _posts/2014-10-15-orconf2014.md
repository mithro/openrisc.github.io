The <a href="http://www.orconf.org">OpenRISC Conference 2014</a> was
held in Munich on the weekend of October 11 and 12, 2014. 36
participants visited the conference which covered some very
interesting topics again.

It was a great thing that the RISC-V guys made it over and we had a
great insight to their ISA and projects. Alex Bradburry also presented
the new lowRISC project, which is based on RISC-V.

We had a great time and it was a pleasure hosting such a conference
with both talks and real discussions. The slides will be online soon.
